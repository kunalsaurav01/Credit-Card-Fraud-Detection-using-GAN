💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection using GAN

This project addresses the extreme class imbalance problem in credit card fraud detection by using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic synthetic fraud transactions.
Instead of duplicating rare fraud samples (like SMOTE), the GAN learns the true fraud distribution and generates high-quality synthetic data.

🚀 Project Motivation

Credit card fraud datasets are highly imbalanced:

Legitimate transactions ≈ 99.8%

Fraud transactions ≈ 0.2%

Traditional classifiers become biased toward the majority class.
This project uses GANs to:

Learn fraud transaction patterns

Generate realistic synthetic fraud samples

Improve downstream fraud detection performance

🧠 Key Concept

GANs generate new fraud samples instead of copying existing ones, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.
